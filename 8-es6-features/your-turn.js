*/

// 1. Use destructuring to extract the name and age from the following object:
const person = { name: "John Doe", age: 30, city: "Anytown" };


// 2. Use the spread operator to merge the following two arrays:
const arr1 = [1, 2, 3];
const arr2 = [4, 5, 6];


// 3. Use template literals to create a sentence that includes the name and age from the person object.


// 4. Use the map array method to double each number in the following array:
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];


// 5. Use the filter array method to get all the even numbers from the numbers array.


// 6. Create a module that exports a function to calculate the area of a circle. Import the function into another file and use it.


// 7. Use optional chaining to safely access the street property of the address object, which may not exist.
const user = { profile: { name: "John Doe" } };


// 8. Write a function that uses default parameters to set a default value for a parameter.
