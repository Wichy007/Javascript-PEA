// This file provides examples of while and do-while loops in JavaScript.

// The while loop executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.
let i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
  console.log(i);
  i++;
}

// The do-while loop is similar to the while loop, but it will execute the code block at least once, even if the condition is false.
let j = 0;
do {
  console.log(j);
  j++;
} while (j < 5);
